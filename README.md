# SimplePasswordGenerator
Something I made within half an hour, just because I haven't programmed anything since forever

Just launch it and it will generate in this pattern: random alphabet without vowels (aeiou) + vowels + alphabet /wo vowels (...) + 2 random numbers from 1-9.

Without the numbers it sometimes reads as if its pokemon names of some sort idk.
